## Difference with Windmill Dashboard

- **Windmill Dashboard** available in HTML (+Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js) and React, **Airmill Dashboard** only provide SvelteKit version.
- **Windmill Dashboard** still using old Tailwind CSS, old Alpine.js, old Chart.js, **Airmill Dashboard** update all packages to the very latest version.
- Some slight layout changes just for **my** taste.
